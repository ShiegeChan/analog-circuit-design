# Summary & Conclusion

By now, you should be familiar with the use of a schematic entry tool (Xschem) and circuit simulator (ngspice). You have learned the basic performance trade-offs, and the large- and small-signal behavior of the MOSFET. You can use the $\gmid$ method to size MOSFET for class-A operation. You can design simple amplifiers based on OTA structures. In summary, you are on a good way to become a good analog or mixed-signal circuit designer!
