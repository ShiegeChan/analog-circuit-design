# Appendix: Middlebrook's Method {#sec-middlebrook-method}

When we want to do a closed-loop gain analysis (for stability or other investigations), we have the need to break the loop at one point, apply a stimulus, and monitor the response on the other end. By doing this we want to keep the loading on both ends similar to the original case. To achieve this, we break the loop at one point by inserting (1) an ac voltage source, and (2) attach an ac current source, as shown in @fig-middlebrook-voltage and @fig-middlebrook-current. The derivation of this approach is presented in [@Middlebrook_1975], and has the big advantage that loading is not changed, and the bias points are also correct.

For both cases we do an ac analysis, and find the corresponding transfer functions $T_\mathrm{v}$ and $T_\mathrm{i}$ as
$$
T_\mathrm{v} = -\frac{V_\mathrm{r}}{V_\mathrm{f}}
$$
and
$$
T_\mathrm{i} = -\frac{I_\mathrm{r}}{I_\mathrm{f}}.
$$

Then, we can calculate the closed-loop transfer function $T(s) = H_\mathrm{ol(s)}$ as
$$
T(s) = \frac{T_\mathrm{v} T_\mathrm{i} - 1}{T_\mathrm{v} + T_\mathrm{i} + 2}.
$$
