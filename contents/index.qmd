## The MOSFET {#sec-mosfet}

In this first chapter we will learn to use Xschem for schematic entry, and how to operate the ngspice SPICE simulator for circuit simulations. Further, we will make ourself familiar with the transistor and other passive components available in the IHP Microelectronics SG13G2 technology. While this is strictly speaking a BiCMOS technology offering MOSFETs as well as SiGe HBTs, we will use it as a pure CMOS technology.

### IHP's SG13G2 130nm CMOS Technology

SG13G2 is the name of a 130nm CMOS technology (strictly speaking BiCMOS) from IHP Microelectronics. It features low-voltage (thin-oxide) core MOSET, high-voltage (thick-oxide) I/O MOSFET, various types of linear resistors, and several layers of metallization. This PDK is open-source, and the complete process specification can be found at [SG13G2 process specification](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_process_spec.pdf). While we will not do layouts in this course, the layout rules can be found at [SG13G2 layout rules](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_layout_rules.pdf).

For our circuit design, the most important parameters of the available devices are summarized in the following:

* Low-voltage NMOS: 
* Low-voltage PMOS:
* High-voltage NMOS:
* High-voltage PMOS:
