When designing circuits it is an important question how to select various parameters of a MOSFET, like $W$, $L$, or the bias current $I_\mathrm{D}$. As a very practical approach we select the $g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}$ methodoloy introduced by B. Murmann [@Jespers_Murmann_2017]. A brief introduction is available [here](https://github.com/iic-jku/analog-circuit-design/blob/main/sizing/Ref_Murmann_gmID.pdf) as well.
